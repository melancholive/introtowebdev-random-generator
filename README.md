# introtowebdev-random-generator

You will create an interactive page that generates some kind of "random" content directed at your visitorâ€“ they can be random "fortunes", outfits to wear, meals to eat, activities to try, horoscopes, character traits... anything at all!

- Write a function called `generate` that will take one argument (your visitor's name or something else) and prints a randomly generated response, pulling random options from an array, into an element of your page.

- Write a function called `restyle` that applies new CSS styles to the `output` text in a random manner each time it fires. Modify at least three CSS properties.
